# ðŸ”¹ Requests and Limits in Kubernetes

## 1. Definition  
**Requests and Limits** in Kubernetes are resource constraints defined for CPU and Memory at the **container level** inside a Pod spec.  

- **Request** â†’ The **minimum guaranteed** CPU/Memory a container needs.  
- **Limit (Cap)** â†’ The **maximum allowed** CPU/Memory a container can consume.  

ðŸ“Œ Together, they are called **Resource Requests and Limits**.  
They ensure Pods get fair resource allocation, prevent resource hogging, and keep the cluster stable.

## 2. Why do we use them?  
- **Requests** â†’ Help the **Kubernetes scheduler** decide which node can host the Pod.  
- **Limits** â†’ Protect nodes by **capping container usage** so one Pod doesnâ€™t affect others.  
- Ensures **fair sharing of resources** in the cluster.  

---

## 3. Terminology / How do we call them?  
- **CPU/Memory Requests** â†’ reserved resources (guaranteed minimum).  
- **CPU/Memory Limits** â†’ capped resources (hard maximum).  
- Together â†’ **Kubernetes Resource Requests and Limits**.  

ðŸ“± **Mobile Data Analogy**  
- **Request** = Minimum data guaranteed (e.g., 1 GB always available).  
- **Limit (Cap)** = Maximum data you can ever use (e.g., 2 GB).  
- If you cross the cap:  
  - Internet slows â†’ CPU throttling.  
  - Internet stops â†’ Memory OOMKilled.

## 4. Example in YAML  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"   # minimum memory guaranteed
        cpu: "250m"       # minimum CPU guaranteed (0.25 core)
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"   # capped at 256Mi (hard maximum)
        cpu: "500m"       # capped at 0.5 CPU (hard maximum)
```

---

## 5. What happens ifâ€¦?  
- **Pod uses < request** â†’ Runs normally.  
- **Pod uses between request & limit** â†’ Allowed to burst (if resources free).  
- **Pod exceeds CPU limit** â†’ Gets **throttled** (slowed down).  
- **Pod exceeds Memory limit** â†’ Gets **OOMKilled** (terminated).  

---

## 6. QoS (Quality of Service) Classes  
- **Guaranteed** â†’ Requests = Limits.  
- **Burstable** â†’ Requests < Limits.  
- **BestEffort** â†’ No requests/limits defined.  

---

## âœ… Final Summary  
- **Requests** = Minimum guarantee (scheduler promise).  
- **Limits** = Maximum cap (runtime enforcement).  
- **Concept name** = *Kubernetes Resource Requests and Limits* (part of Kubernetes Resource Management).  
- Think of it like a **mobile data plan** â†’ request = guaranteed GB, limit = maximum GB (cap).
